Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Reagan McFarland, a computer science student at Rutgers University who really likes using Rust and working on side projects.
I occasionally make blog posts here :)

I am currently working on [nakala](https://github.com/reaganmcf/nakala), a hobby programming language of mine. Besides that, I also like contributing to various open source projects.
